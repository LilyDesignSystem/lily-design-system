# Changelog — `<lily-gantt-chart>` (Web Components helper)

The format is loosely based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/)
and the project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## 0.6.0 — 2026-10-17

- Added weekend shading: `weekends` (weekdays, 0 = Sunday … 6 = Saturday; never defaulted) marks day columns `data-weekend` on the header and every cell. The 57 reference themes tint them.
- Added dependency arrows: `dependencyArrows` draws an `aria-hidden` SVG arrow per dependency by its type (`e2s`, `s2s`, `s2e`, `e2e`), measured from the rendered cells; the text description remains.
- Exports `dependencyPath` and `weekdayOfEpochDay` (pure, tested).

## 0.5.0 — 2026-10-16

- Added typed task fields (`fields`, `task.values`, `locale`) as columns between the task name and the timeline, using the data grid's cell types.
- Added inline field editing (`onFieldEdit`): click a value, F2, Tab to the next field; typed editors, IME-safe, refused when invalid for the type, announced.
- Added export to CSV, TSV and Excel (`labels.exportCsv` etc., `labels.exportHeaders`, `exportScope`, `exportFilename`, `onExport`); dates are real dates in Excel.
- Added `virtualize` (windowed rows with spacers, `aria-rowcount` / `aria-rowindex`).
- Marker, today and task lookups are computed once per change instead of per cell.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-10-16

- Added unscheduled tasks, ported from the Svelte 0.4.0: a task with no `start` / `end` renders its row with no bar (`data-unscheduled`); Enter opens the edit region with empty dates and Save stays disabled until both are set, which schedules it through `onTaskChange`. An unscheduled child does not shape its parent's span; drag and Alt+Arrow do nothing for it.
- Added `collapsedTaskIds` (property; `onCollapsedTaskIdsChange` and a `collapsechange` event report user changes) and `labels.expandAll` / `labels.collapseAll` buttons that expand or collapse every parent task.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-10-14

- Added a progress field in the edit region, baselines and typed dependencies, ported from the Svelte 0.3.0.
- Added a zoom control, drag-resize handles, task selection, Alt+Arrow shift and resize, and `taskAttrs`, ported from the Svelte 0.3.0.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-10-14

- Added `readonly`, `markers`, `isNonWorking`, and task `type`, `critical` and `slack` data hooks, ported from the Svelte 0.2.0.

## Unreleased — 2026-10-11

Fixed: row depth is `data-depth`, not an inline style; orphaned `parentId`s render as top-level rows and cycles no longer
hang; the edit region takes focus on open and returns it to the grid on Save/Cancel/Escape; a range entered end-first is
saved start-first and Save is disabled while a date is empty; collapse and edit controls do not render unnamed. Added
`labels.taskColumnHeader` and `effectiveRanges`. See the repository CHANGELOG (2026-10-11) and `spec/index.md` §8.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-22

Initial release. Direct port of `@lilydesignsystem/svelte-gantt-chart`.
Composes `@lilydesignsystem/web-components-headless`'s
`<lily-gantt-table>` (unmodified) and, twice per edit session, the
sibling helper `@lilydesignsystem/web-components-date-time-picker` —
this catalog's first helper-to-helper composition. Civil-date
arithmetic is reused from `date-time-picker` rather than re-derived.
