# Changelog — ShareButton (Svelte)

All notable changes to this helper are documented in this file. The
format is loosely based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/)
and the project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## 0.1.0 — 2026-07-20

### Added

- Initial release. A headless share control: a single-glyph button
  (↪, U+21AA) that opens the **native share sheet** via `navigator.share`
  where the browser provides one, and otherwise a disclosure list of
  consumer-supplied destinations plus a built-in copy-the-URL action.
- `targets` are supplied by the consumer, each with its own `href(url,
  title, text)` function. **No social-network endpoints ship with this
  package** — which networks belong in a product is an editorial and
  privacy decision, the URLs change, and networks die.
- Destinations render as real `<a>` elements rather than
  `role="menuitem"`, preserving middle-click, open-in-new-tab and
  copy-link-address. Copy is a real `<button>`.
- Copy outcome is announced in an `aria-live="polite"` region.
  `copyLabel`, `copiedLabel` and `copyFailedLabel` are all props — the
  copy item renders only when named, since a default label would be a
  hardcoded English string.
- Keyboard: arrows move between items and clamp, Home/End jump, Escape
  closes and returns focus to the trigger, Tab closes and moves on.
- Exports `canShareNatively`, `canCopy`, `nextShareButtonId`,
  `RIGHTWARDS_ARROW_WITH_HOOK`.

### Notes

- Unlike the `*-select` helpers, this owns an *action*, not a preference:
  it applies nothing to the document and persists nothing.
- The trigger's class hook is `share-button-trigger`, not
  `share-button-button` — the one deliberate bend in the
  `{helper}-button` convention, since `.share-button-button` reads badly.
- Behaviour differs by platform when `strategy="auto"`: a phone gets the
  OS sheet, a desktop gets the list. Documented in
  `docs/accessibility.md` rather than glossed.
