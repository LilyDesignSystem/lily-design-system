# Picture

A headless wrapper around the native picture element: the browser chooses among its source children and falls back to the img child.

## Canonical documentation

See [components/picture/index.md](../../components/picture/index.md) for the full component documentation: behaviour, props and guidance.

## Usage

```html
<lily-picture>
  <source srcset="wide.webp" media="(min-width: 800px)" type="image/webp">
  <img src="small.jpg" alt="A lily in bloom" width="320" height="200">
</lily-picture>
```

## Contract

The native `<picture class="picture">`; sources and img as children, rest props only; no ARIA, state or strings. The img's `alt` is the consumer's.
